Citation Policy â€” Vitex Guide

Scope

This policy explains how we select, cite, and display sources. Our standard prioritizes high-quality evidence for clinical claims and clear attribution for factual statements.

Source selection

- Prioritize systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical guidelines, and major institution statements (e.g., NIH, Cochrane, PubMed Central entries).
- When primary studies are used, include methodological notes (sample size, comparator, duration) in the article.
- Avoid relying on low-quality blogs, forum posts, or single-case anecdotes as primary evidence.

Citation format

- Inline citations: We include inline links to the source text where the claim is made.
- Sources block: Every article ends with a Sources section listing full URLs or DOIs.

Verification and edits

- Editors must verify that each linked source supports the claim.
- If a source is paywalled, indicate the study's citation info (DOI, journal, year) and summarize the relevant finding accurately.
