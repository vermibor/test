Editorial Policy — Vitex Guide

Purpose

Vitex Guide publishes evidence-focused educational content about Vitex (chasteberry) and related women’s hormonal health topics. Our editorial mission is accuracy, transparency, and conservative medical framing.

Workflow

- Drafting: Content is initially drafted using AI-assisted tools to speed research and outline creation.
- Human editing: Every article is edited and reviewed by a human editor with health content experience. Medical claims are reviewed for tone, accuracy, and sourcing.
- Final sign-off: A named editor (or editorial lead) signs off before publication.

Mandatory checklist for every published article

1. Title, author, date, and tags included in front matter (for Markdown files).
2. Clear medical disclaimer visible at top of article and in the footer.
3. At least 5 credible sources for cornerstones (3 for short Q&A), with preference for systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, clinical guidelines, and reputable institutions.
4. Inline citations for factual claims; a Sources block with DOIs or URLs at the end of the article.
5. No personalized dosing or medical advice. Use conservative phrasing: 'may help', 'limited evidence', 'consult a clinician'.
6. Safety/contraindications section where relevant (pregnancy, breastfeeding, drug interactions).
7. Affiliate disclosure present on product pages and where affiliate links appear.
8. Accessibility checks: alt text for images, semantic headings, color contrast.
9. SEO basics: meta title and description, descriptive URL, H1/H2 structure.

Corrections and updates

- Corrections: If a factual error is reported, the editorial lead will investigate and correct within 3 business days. A note describing the correction (date, nature) will be added to the article.
- Updates: Cornerstone articles should be reviewed every 6–12 months or sooner if major new evidence emerges.
