Short answer: No single formulation is 'best' for everyone. Capsules/extracts offer convenience and standardized doses; tinctures/liquid extracts may allow dose titration. Choice depends on product quality, standardization, and personal preference.

Longer explanation: Review formulation pros/cons and check product labels for extract concentrations.
