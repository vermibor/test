This cornerstone expands on known adverse events, drug interactions (dopaminergic drugs, hormonal therapies), cautions for pregnancy and breastfeeding, and monitoring advice. It emphasizes conservative framing and advises consulting a clinician for individual circumstances.

Takeaway: Vitex is generally well tolerated in trials but may interact with certain medications and should be avoided or discussed with a clinician during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
