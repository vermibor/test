This article summarizes dosing ranges reported in clinical trials and common formulations: whole-fruit capsules, standardized extracts, and liquid extracts/tinctures. It does not provide personalized dosing and emphasizes consulting a clinician.

Common trial ranges (illustrative):

- Capsules/extracts: 20–40 mg/day (varies by standardization)
- Dried fruit preparations: 1,000–2,000 mg/day (varies by product)

Note: Interpret with caution — formulations and extract concentrations differ across products and trials.
