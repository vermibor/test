Vitex agnus-castus (chasteberry) is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. The dried fruit ("chasteberry") is used in herbal medicine for menstrual and reproductive health. Proposed mechanisms include dopaminergic activity affecting prolactin and possible interactions with ovarian hormones, though exact mechanisms remain under study.

See the Sources section and our editorial policy for how we evaluate evidence.

Takeaway: Vitex is widely used and has some clinical evidence for certain menstrual symptoms, but users should consult a clinician and consider safety notes.
